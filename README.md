# Homework Week1 - HTML
This assignment was to correct or reorganize the "unbroken" website provided. Turning a wet code into a dry code. 

## First steps

The first thing to correct or format was the HTML file. It used the general container <div> instead of organizing it into sections and articles preventing a
place for search engines and such to distingusih from the important to the irrelevant. 

## Second steps
This was to clean up the repatative nature in the CSS file. Combining the .benefit-lead, .benifit-brand, and .benefit-cost propoties into one 
coheasive line of code, making this "dry".

## Conclusion
Even thought the code is technically not broken, cleaning it up this way not only is useful but is best practice for structure and quaility of code.
